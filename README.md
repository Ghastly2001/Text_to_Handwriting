# Text_to_Handwriting
I have created a new text to handwriting converter with the help of python library name pywhtkit.\
You can use this code by downloading the zip or cloning.\
If you face any error in importing pywhatkit be sure to install pywhatkit in termimal by typing "-pip install pywhatkit".\
If you face any error in installing pywhatkit be sure to upgrade your pip, for that you need to type in command prompt "pip install --updrade pip".
